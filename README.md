# SQL Exercises

This repository contains a series of SQL exercises designed to build foundational skills in database querying, data manipulation, and analysis. It includes three individual assignments that focus on different aspects of SQL, as well as one group project to encourage collaborative problem-solving.

## Project Overview
This repository is structured to provide hands-on practice with SQL through a progression of exercises and assignments. Each assignment focuses on core SQL concepts, such as SELECT statements, joins, subqueries, and data aggregation. The group project serves as a capstone, combining concepts from all previous assignments in a collaborative environment.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Basic SQL Queries
- **Objective**: Practice fundamental SQL skills, including basic SELECT statements, filtering with WHERE, ordering with ORDER BY, and limiting results.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Basic data retrieval using `SELECT`
  - Filtering rows with `WHERE`
  - Sorting results using `ORDER BY`
  - Limiting the output with `LIMIT`

### Assignment 2: Advanced SQL Queries and Joins
- **Objective**: Deepen understanding of relational data by working with multiple tables and performing various joins.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN
  - Combining data from multiple tables
  - Aggregating data with GROUP BY
  - Using HAVING for filtering aggregated results

### Assignment 3: Subqueries and Data Aggregation
- **Objective**: Explore complex queries with nested subqueries and learn data aggregation techniques.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Writing subqueries in the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses
  - Aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
  - Grouping and filtering aggregated data

### Group Project: Database Design and Complex Querying
- **Objective**: Apply SQL knowledge to a real-world scenario by designing a database and implementing complex queries to analyze data.
- **Requirements**:
  - Design and create a database schema
  - Write complex queries that combine multiple tables, subqueries, and aggregations
  - Present results as insights or visualizations
